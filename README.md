## Narrative
The purpose of the app is to have a easy way to see the classes you have taken. You could use this information to easily show others what you have learned.

## Cool Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s a snippet of code:

```javascript
// Show Delete Confirmation
function showDeleteConfirmation(log, listItem, index, classData) {
    const confirmationBox = document.createElement('div');
    confirmationBox.className = 'confirmation-box mt-2';
    confirmationBox.innerHTML = `
        <p>Delete "<strong>${log.class}</strong>"?</p>
        <button class="btn btn-danger btn-sm confirm-delete-btn">Delete</button>
        <button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm cancel-delete-btn">Cancel</button>
    `;

    listItem.appendChild(confirmationBox);

    confirmationBox.querySelector('.confirm-delete-btn').onclick = () => deleteRecord(index, classData, listItem);
    confirmationBox.querySelector('.cancel-delete-btn').onclick = () => confirmationBox.remove();
}
```
This code creates a confirmation prompt for the use to delete a class they have listed. 
This is great because by adding the confirmation you get rid of the risk of accidentally 
deleting one of your classes.
