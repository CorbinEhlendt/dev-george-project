## üß© Cool Code Snippet

Here‚Äôs a snippet I‚Äôm proud of:

```javascript
loginBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
  if (loggedIn) {
    loggedIn = false;
    userNameSpan.textContent = '';
    loginBtn.textContent = 'Login';
    loginBtn.setAttribute('data-bs-toggle', 'modal');
    loginBtn.setAttribute('data-bs-target', '#loginModal');
  }
});
